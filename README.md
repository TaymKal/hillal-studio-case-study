Project Overview
A minimalist React portfolio built for an interior design studio to showcase high-end professional projects.

Tech & Workflow
Stack: React & TypeScript.

Deployment: Configured and managed hosting via Plesk.

Efficiency: Used AI-assisted development to accelerate scaffolding and logic, reducing delivery time by 65%.

Key Challenges & Solutions
Asset Performance: To maintain high visual quality without heavy libraries, we manually compressed and scaled 50+ professional images before deployment.

Hosting: First-time implementation on Plesk; handled server configuration and security.

No-CMS Model: Hard-coded architecture to ensure design precision and lower maintenance costs.

Business & Professional Side
Client Management: Secured the contract, led weekly requirements meetings, and managed the feedback loop through to production sign-off.

Production Delivery: Responsible for the full lifecycle, from acquisition to live deployment.
